- Look at the entire list of classes for the semester and then build a plan based off the best professors and timings instead of just listing classes to take. Add filters like No 8 AM classes, or all classes on Mon/Wed. 
- Academic copilot using AI
- Add a Professor Rating
- In the community add a feature where people can verify their generated plan with other students
- Add a academic community where students can chat with one another for specific classes
