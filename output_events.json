        "description": "Join the SJSU King Library and the San Jos√© Museum of Art to experience a special satellite exhibit that explores the intersection between art and advertising.    On display and integrated among campus advertising on the 4th and 5th floor digital screens of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library in addition to various locations in downtown San Jos√©, is the first major exhibition of Pao Houa Her's photographic practice, Pao Houa Her: The Imaginative Landscape. The exhibit traces the artist's deepening exploration of diasporic constructions of homeland among her Hmong American community.  Visit the San Jos√© Museum of Art between July 11, 2025- February 22, 2026 to experience the full exhibit. Pao Houa Her: The Imaginative Landscape is an unconventional survey of over 20 years. Seen through the expansive titular series, it traces conceptual ties between past series, new work, and work still under development, connecting California agricultural landscapes to the jungles of Laos, poppy fields in Minnesota, and beyond. The exhibition is co-organized by Lauren Schell Dickens, chief curator at SJMA, and Jodi Throckmorton, chief curator at John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and will be presented at both organizations simultaneously.  Pao Houa Her's practice engages with the legacies, potentials, and aesthetics of landscape and portrait photography traditions, examining the complex intertwining of desire, homeland, and artifice. Rooted in the experience of her Hmong community and shaped by family experiences and lore passed down by her elders, Her's work centers women as the knowledge bearers of both past and future. Using a formally rigorous photographic approach, Her explores constructions of homeland that resonate across diasporas.",

Presented by Centro Aztlan Chicomoztoc, this exhibit re-examines one of California's most misrepresented historical figures, Tiburcio V√°squez. A resister of California's colonial status following the annexation of Mexican territory in 1848, V√°squez's legacy reflects both the upheavals of 19th-century California and the enduring spirit of its multicultural communities.  The exhibit demonstrates that Tiburcio V√°squez was not merely an outlaw, but a freedom fighter resisting colonial power and occupation.  As part of Centro Aztlan Chicomoztoc's Stolen Histories of California series, the exhibit will feature panel discussions, scholarly lectures, school tours, and community forums with Chicano historians, legal experts, and cultural educators.  EVENTS:   Live and Zoom presentations on Sept. 24th, 2025 from 5-7 p.m   Other presentations: Oct. 1, Oct. 8, Oct. 15, Oct. 22, and Oct. 26, every Wednesday 5-7 p.m.   CONTACT:  Centro Azlan Chicomoztoc   47 East William Street, San Jose, CA 95112  408-849-0793  Email: centroazltansanjose@gmail.com  Website: https://www.centroaztlanchicomoztoc.org/  Did you visit this exhibit?

On display and integrated among campus advertising on the 4th and 5th floor digital screens of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library in addition to various locations in downtown San Jos√©, is the first major exhibition of Pao Houa Her's photographic practice, Pao Houa Her: The Imaginative Landscape. The exhibit traces the artist's deepening exploration of diasporic constructions of homeland among her Hmong American community.  Visit the San Jos√© Museum of Art between July 11, 2025- February 22, 2026 to experience the full exhibit. Pao Houa Her: The Imaginative Landscape is an unconventional survey of over 20 years. Seen through the expansive titular series, it traces conceptual ties between past series, new work, and work still under development, connecting California agricultural landscapes to the jungles of Laos, poppy fields in Minnesota, and beyond. The exhibition is co-organized by Lauren Schell Dickens, chief curator at SJMA, and Jodi Throckmorton, chief curator at John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and will be presented at both organizations simultaneously.  Pao Houa Her's practice engages with the legacies, potentials, and aesthetics of landscape and portrait photography traditions, examining the complex intertwining of desire, homeland, and artifice. Rooted in the experience of her Hmong community and shaped by family experiences and lore passed down by her elders, Her's work centers women as the knowledge bearers of both past and future. Using a formally rigorous photographic approach, Her explores constructions of homeland that resonate across diasporas.",

Presented by Centro Aztlan Chicomoztoc, this exhibit re-examines one of California's most misrepresented historical figures, Tiburcio V√°squez. A resister of California's colonial status following the annexation of Mexican territory in 1848, V√°squez's legacy reflects both the upheavals of 19th-century California and the enduring spirit of its multicultural communities.  The exhibit demonstrates that Tiburcio V√°squez was not merely an outlaw, but a freedom fighter resisting colonial power and occupation.  As part of Centro Aztlan Chicomoztoc's Stolen Histories of California series, the exhibit will feature panel discussions, scholarly lectures, school tours, and community forums with Chicano historians, legal experts, and cultural educators.  EVENTS:   Live and Zoom presentations on Sept. 24th, 2025 from 5-7 p.m   Other presentations: Oct. 1, Oct. 8, Oct. 15, Oct. 22, and Oct. 26, every Wednesday 5-7 p.m.   CONTACT:  Centro Azlan Chicomoztoc   47 East William Street, San Jose, CA 95112  408-849-0793  Email: centroazltansanjose@gmail.com  Website: https://www.centroaztlanchicomoztoc.org/  Did you visit this exhibit?

Directed by Academy Award¬Æ-winner Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire), Frankenstein features Benedict Cumberbatch (Hamlet, BBC's Sherlock) and Jonny Lee Miller (Elementary, Trainspotting) alternating between the roles of Victor Frankenstein and his creation.  Childlike in his innocence but grotesque in form, Frankenstein's bewildered creature is cast out into a hostile universe by his horror-struck maker. Meeting with cruelty wherever he goes, the increasingly desperate and vengeful Creature determines to track down his creator and strike a terrifying deal.  Scientific responsibility, parental neglect, cognitive development and the nature of good and evil, are embedded within this thrilling and deeply disturbing classic tale.  Captured live on stage in 2011, this thrilling, sold-out production became an international sensation, experienced by almost half a million people in cinemas around the world.  Runtime: 120 minutes Rating: R  All tickets are general admission.

On display and integrated among campus advertising on the 4th and 5th floor digital screens of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library in addition to various locations in downtown San Jos√©, is the first major exhibition of Pao Houa Her's photographic practice, Pao Houa Her: The Imaginative Landscape. The exhibit traces the artist's deepening exploration of diasporic constructions of homeland among her Hmong American community.  Visit the San Jos√© Museum of Art between July 11, 2025- February 22, 2026 to experience the full exhibit. Pao Houa Her: The Imaginative Landscape is an unconventional survey of over 20 years. Seen through the expansive titular series, it traces conceptual ties between past series, new work, and work still under development, connecting California agricultural landscapes to the jungles of Laos, poppy fields in Minnesota, and beyond. The exhibition is co-organized by Lauren Schell Dickens, chief curator at SJMA, and Jodi Throckmorton, chief curator at John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and will be presented at both organizations simultaneously.  Pao Houa Her's practice engages with the legacies, potentials, and aesthetics of landscape and portrait photography traditions, examining the complex intertwining of desire, homeland, and artifice. Rooted in the experience of her Hmong community and shaped by family experiences and lore passed down by her elders, Her's work centers women as the knowledge bearers of both past and future. Using a formally rigorous photographic approach, Her explores constructions of homeland that resonate across diasporas.",

Presented by Centro Aztlan Chicomoztoc, this exhibit re-examines one of California's most misrepresented historical figures, Tiburcio V√°squez. A resister of California's colonial status following the annexation of Mexican territory in 1848, V√°squez's legacy reflects both the upheavals of 19th-century California and the enduring spirit of its multicultural communities.  The exhibit demonstrates that Tiburcio V√°squez was not merely an outlaw, but a freedom fighter resisting colonial power and occupation.  As part of Centro Aztlan Chicomoztoc's Stolen Histories of California series, the exhibit will feature panel discussions, scholarly lectures, school tours, and community forums with Chicano historians, legal experts, and cultural educators.  EVENTS:   Live and Zoom presentations on Sept. 24th, 2025 from 5-7 p.m   Other presentations: Oct. 1, Oct. 8, Oct. 15, Oct. 22, and Oct. 26, every Wednesday 5-7 p.m.   CONTACT:  Centro Azlan Chicomoztoc   47 East William Street, San Jose, CA 95112  408-849-0793  Email: centroazltansanjose@gmail.com  Website: https://www.centroaztlanchicomoztoc.org/  Did you visit this exhibit?

        "description": "Join the SJSU King Library and the San Jos√© Museum of Art to experience a special satellite exhibit that explores the intersection between art and advertising.    On display and integrated among campus advertising on the 4th and 5th floor digital screens of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library in addition to various locations in downtown San Jos√©, is the first major exhibition of Pao Houa Her's photographic practice, Pao Houa Her: The Imaginative Landscape. The exhibit traces the artist's deepening exploration of diasporic constructions of homeland among her Hmong American community.  Visit the San Jos√© Museum of Art between July 11, 2025- February 22, 2026 to experience the full exhibit. Pao Houa Her: The Imaginative Landscape is an unconventional survey of over 20 years. Seen through the expansive titular series, it traces conceptual ties between past series, new work, and work still under development, connecting California agricultural landscapes to the jungles of Laos, poppy fields in Minnesota, and beyond. The exhibition is co-organized by Lauren Schell Dickens, chief curator at SJMA, and Jodi Throckmorton, chief curator at John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and will be presented at both organizations simultaneously.  Pao Houa Her's practice engages with the legacies, potentials, and aesthetics of landscape and portrait photography traditions, examining the complex intertwining of desire, homeland, and artifice. Rooted in the experience of her Hmong community and shaped by family experiences and lore passed down by her elders, Her's work centers women as the knowledge bearers of both past and future. Using a formally rigorous photographic approach, Her explores constructions of homeland that resonate across diasporas.",

        "description": "In celebration of Latinx Heritage Month, visit the new exhibition, Tiburcio Vasquez and His Times,  which opens this September 22nd at the Jennifer and Philip DiNapoli Gallery in the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library.    Presented by Centro Aztlan Chicomoztoc, this exhibit re-examines one of California's most misrepresented historical figures, Tiburcio V√°squez. A resister of California's colonial status following the annexation of Mexican territory in 1848, V√°squez's legacy reflects both the upheavals of 19th-century California and the enduring spirit of its multicultural communities.  The exhibit demonstrates that Tiburcio V√°squez was not merely an outlaw, but a freedom fighter resisting colonial power and occupation.  As part of Centro Aztlan Chicomoztoc's Stolen Histories of California series, the exhibit will feature panel discussions, scholarly lectures, school tours, and community forums with Chicano historians, legal experts, and cultural educators.  EVENTS:   Live and Zoom presentations on Sept. 24th, 2025 from 5-7 p.m   Other presentations: Oct. 1, Oct. 8, Oct. 15, Oct. 22, and Oct. 26, every Wednesday 5-7 p.m.   CONTACT:  Centro Azlan Chicomoztoc   47 East William Street, San Jose, CA 95112  408-849-0793  Email: centroazltansanjose@gmail.com  Website: https://www.centroaztlanchicomoztoc.org/  Did you visit this exhibit?

On display and integrated among campus advertising on the 4th and 5th floor digital screens of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library in addition to various locations in downtown San Jos√©, is the first major exhibition of Pao Houa Her's photographic practice, Pao Houa Her: The Imaginative Landscape. The exhibit traces the artist's deepening exploration of diasporic constructions of homeland among her Hmong American community.  Visit the San Jos√© Museum of Art between July 11, 2025- February 22, 2026 to experience the full exhibit. Pao Houa Her: The Imaginative Landscape is an unconventional survey of over 20 years. Seen through the expansive titular series, it traces conceptual ties between past series, new work, and work still under development, connecting California agricultural landscapes to the jungles of Laos, poppy fields in Minnesota, and beyond. The exhibition is co-organized by Lauren Schell Dickens, chief curator at SJMA, and Jodi Throckmorton, chief curator at John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and will be presented at both organizations simultaneously.  Pao Houa Her's practice engages with the legacies, potentials, and aesthetics of landscape and portrait photography traditions, examining the complex intertwining of desire, homeland, and artifice. Rooted in the experience of her Hmong community and shaped by family experiences and lore passed down by her elders, Her's work centers women as the knowledge bearers of both past and future. Using a formally rigorous photographic approach, Her explores constructions of homeland that resonate across diasporas.",

        "description": "Join the SJSU King Library and the San Jos√© Museum of Art to experience a special satellite exhibit that explores the intersection between art and advertising.    On display and integrated among campus advertising on the 4th and 5th floor digital screens of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library in addition to various locations in downtown San Jos√©, is the first major exhibition of Pao Houa Her's photographic practice, Pao Houa Her: The Imaginative Landscape. The exhibit traces the artist's deepening exploration of diasporic constructions of homeland among her Hmong American community.  Visit the San Jos√© Museum of Art between July 11, 2025- February 22, 2026 to experience the full exhibit. Pao Houa Her: The Imaginative Landscape is an unconventional survey of over 20 years. Seen through the expansive titular series, it traces conceptual ties between past series, new work, and work still under development, connecting California agricultural landscapes to the jungles of Laos, poppy fields in Minnesota, and beyond. The exhibition is co-organized by Lauren Schell Dickens, chief curator at SJMA, and Jodi Throckmorton, chief curator at John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and will be presented at both organizations simultaneously.  Pao Houa Her's practice engages with the legacies, potentials, and aesthetics of landscape and portrait photography traditions, examining the complex intertwining of desire, homeland, and artifice. Rooted in the experience of her Hmong community and shaped by family experiences and lore passed down by her elders, Her's work centers women as the knowledge bearers of both past and future. Using a formally rigorous photographic approach, Her explores constructions of homeland that resonate across diasporas.",

Presented by Centro Aztlan Chicomoztoc, this exhibit re-examines one of California's most misrepresented historical figures, Tiburcio V√°squez. A resister of California's colonial status following the annexation of Mexican territory in 1848, V√°squez's legacy reflects both the upheavals of 19th-century California and the enduring spirit of its multicultural communities.  The exhibit demonstrates that Tiburcio V√°squez was not merely an outlaw, but a freedom fighter resisting colonial power and occupation.  As part of Centro Aztlan Chicomoztoc's Stolen Histories of California series, the exhibit will feature panel discussions, scholarly lectures, school tours, and community forums with Chicano historians, legal experts, and cultural educators.  EVENTS:   Live and Zoom presentations on Sept. 24th, 2025 from 5-7 p.m   Other presentations: Oct. 1, Oct. 8, Oct. 15, Oct. 22, and Oct. 26, every Wednesday 5-7 p.m.   CONTACT:  Centro Azlan Chicomoztoc   47 East William Street, San Jose, CA 95112  408-849-0793  Email: centroazltansanjose@gmail.com  Website: https://www.centroaztlanchicomoztoc.org/  Did you visit this exhibit?

        "description": "Chris Eckert - Meaningful Mechanisms: Exploring humanity through technology  Chris Eckert is an artist working in Southern California. His sculptures have been shown throughout the United States and Europe including venues in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Austria, Germany, France, Switzerland, and Japan. Eckert received his BS and MS in Mechanical Engineering from Santa Clara University and his MFA from San Jose State University.  My work reflects ideas and questions I find perplexing. While some find machinery cold and impersonal, I find a vehicle for exploration and introspection. I combine intricate mechanisms, custom electronics, and sophisticated programing in mechanisms which question our relationship with technology, information, religion, and privacy. If my ideas are authentic and personally relevant, I have confidence people can form profound and intimate connections with my work.",
