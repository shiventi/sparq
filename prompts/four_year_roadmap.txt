SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS

You are given a four-year SJSU course roadmap in free-text form.
Your task is to output only one valid JSON array.
Do not include any explanations, notes, comments, or text outside the JSON array.
If you are unsure about something, make the safest possible assumption following these rules.

OUTPUT FORMAT

Each element in the JSON array is one roadmap item:

{
  "year": 1,
  "semester": "Fall",
  "name": "ADV_91",
  "units": 3
}


year: Integer 1, 2, 3, 4 based on roadmap header (“Year 1”, “Year 2” …).

semester: "Fall" or "Spring" depending on roadmap header.

name:

Always uppercase course codes, replace spaces and special characters with underscores (e.g., “ADV 91” → "ADV_91", “GE Area 1A” → "GE_Area_1A").

If the line is an elective, use "Art_Elective", "JMC_Elective", "Upper_Division_Humanities_Arts_Elective_Course", etc. Use underscores to join words.

For “University Elective – Lower or Upper Division” write "University_Elective_Lower_or_Upper_Division".

For generic non-course actions like “Apply for the Agency” or “Apply to Graduate” set "name" to "Apply_for_the_Agency" or "Apply_to_Graduate" and "units": 0.

units:

Integer unit count if a single number is shown.

If a range appears (like “3-4 unit(s)”), store as a string "3-4" (be consistent for all ranges).

If no units listed for an action item, always use "units": 0.

MULTIPLE OPTIONS (“AND” / “OR”)

If a course listing shows multiple options separated by “or”, return as an array.
Prefix the first element with "||" to indicate OR:

"name": ["||ART_44HA","DSGN_44HA","ENGL_44HA","HUM_44HA","PHIL_44HA"]


If a course listing shows multiple options separated by “and”, return as an array.
Prefix the first element with "&&" to indicate AND:

"name": ["&&MATH_30","PHYS_50"]


For “one course from:”, “choose from:”, “select one:” apply the same rule as for OR.

GENERAL RULES

Every course, elective, or action is its own object in the JSON array.

Keep the original order (year by year, semester by semester).

Ignore asterisks or notes unless they are part of the course name (“GE Area 3A*” still → "GE_Area_3A").

Do not merge two different items into one.

Never include comments, footnotes, roadmap notes, or explanations outside of "name" and "units".

Never output anything except the JSON array. No headings, no “Here is your JSON”, no backticks.
